## Building the documentation

Source files for the documentation can be found in `docs/source` directory. In order to 
build the HTML docs, you need to install the developer dependencies
by running:

    $ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

This installs Sphinx (among other things), which is required in building the documentation.
When Sphinx is installed, you can build the HTML pages from the source files by running:

    > bin\build_doc.bat
    
or

    $ bin/build_doc.py
    
depending on your operating system.        
 
After running the build, the index page can be found in `docs/build/html/index.html`.
